In running a print shop there are multiple considerations. If it is a university print shop, the first consideration is adherence to any relevant business or academic policies under the university. Those are dependent on the specific university and the business environment. Another consideration is optimizing for quality and timeliness for each person. Considerations like fairness are under quality – that the product, or the delivery of the product, is always up to specifications, regardless of circumstances. We can also optimize for timeliness. Under timeliness are multiple considerations, including predictability and speed. For speed I tried to quantify it by calculating the percent difference between the total waiting times for the FIFO Queue and the other queues. The SJF queue’s time did decrease by approximately 7%, however it’s average waiting time was much longer at 5 seconds versus both the FIFO and the Multi-level queue. The multi-level queue performed similarly to the FIFO queue, being only about 1 percent slower than the FIFO queue. For fairness I tried to quantify it by calculating the standard deviation of the average time for each category. The multi-level queue was the most “unfair”, with the highest standard deviation, then the FIFO first coming in second, and the shortest job being the “fairest” with the lowest standard deviation. Then finally I tried to quantify the consistency by calculating the percent difference between the average longest wait and the average time. The FIFO and SJF queues had a similar percent difference, with the multi-level queue having much more variability.
